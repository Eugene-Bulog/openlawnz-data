regex for legislation

(( section(s)* | s{1,2} ) *(\d{1,4}\w*))( and \d*)*

this will match on "section #" or "s #" or "ss 4" and also where that is followed by "and #" to cover something like
"Sections 4 and 5" or "ss 4 and 5"
Should not fail on subsections eg ss4(1) and 5 should still match

Logic probably should be

Section name is obtained by matching on regex for sections above

Next step: get 10 words either side of match
Look in those 10 words for any legislation title
(Have an array of legislation titles?)
