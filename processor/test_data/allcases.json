I have read the application. There is nothing set out in the application that satisfies the tests for recall of judgment.\n[2] Rule 11.9 of the High Court Rules provides for the recall of a judgment any time before a formal record of it is drawn up and sealed. The annotation to r 11.9 notes that recall of a judgment is a serious step to be taken only in reasonably well identified situations. The leading statement on recall of judgments is to be found in Horowhenua County v Nash (No 2):1\nGenerally speaking a judgment once delivered must stand for better or worse subject, of course, to appeal. Were it otherwise there would be great inconvenience and uncertainty. There are, I think, three categories of cases in which a judgment not perfected may be recalled � first, where since the hearing there has been an amendment to a relevant statute or regulation or a new judicial decision of relevance and high authority; secondly where counsel have failed to direct the court's attention to a legislative provision of authoritative decision of plain relevance; and thirdly where for some other very special reason justice requires that the judgment by recalled. [3] In Unison Networks Ltd v Commerce Commission2 the Court of Appeal concluded that the third category was intended to be narrow and that cases appropriate for recall on that basis are likely to be rare. Examples of cases falling within the third category are set out at 11.901(5) of the High Court Rules. I have carefully considered all of those examples. None of them apply to the circumstances before me. I am satisfied that the present application is not appropriate for recall and accordingly the application for recall is dismissed.\n1 Horowhenua County v Nash (No 2) [1968] NZLR 632 (NZSC) at 633. 2 *********************************************************** Hannan v FM Custodians Limited [2017] NZHC 2, [2017] 1 NZLR 1234.\n\n\f",

FM CUSTODIANS LTD v HANNAN [2017] NZHC 3286 [21 December 2017]\n\n\f[3] Mr Hannan filed his application for interim injunction without notice on 9 October 2017, seeking urgency, because the receiver of Paddy Hannan Contracting Ltd, Mr Whitley authorised Bayley's Real Estate to place the property on the market for tender. After three previous unsuccessful attempts, the Lower Hutt City Council had signed a conditional Sale and Purchase Agreement, which was to become unconditional on Friday 13 October 2017. Mr Hannan stated his reason for seeking an injunction was to prevent the sale of property, until the determination of his defended bankruptcy proceedings, which had been reserved for the decision of Associate Judge Smith.\n[4] I directed that the without notice interlocutory application for injunction together with the affidavit of Mr Hannan and his undertaking, be served by way of pickwick service on the receiver, Mr Whitley of Auckland, Bayley's Real Estate Ltd and FM Custodians Ltd, the judgment creditor.2\nThe hearing on 12 October 2017\n[5] The hearing took place on 12 October 2017.

Apart from filing submissions prior to the defended hearing, Stuart had become less interested and did not wish to take any further steps, including not coming to New Zealand to give evidence in support of his pleaded defence. The question arising of whether Mr Pratley is entitled to be indemnified from the New Zealand assets of the estate, in respect of his costs and expenses incurred in defending Steven's District Court claim, will be determined by the finding on whether it was necessary to take those steps.\n[4] The question of whether Mr Pratley's costs and expenses were reasonable, in respect of the administration of the estate, is to be determined by an experienced practitioner dealing with estates. A determination from this Court is not required.\nAgreements reached on liabilities [5] This decision should be read with the principal decision, where the background facts, concerning the Family Protection Act 1995 claim, are fully canvassed.3 Following the principal judgment, counsel for the parties have each agreed on the following orders under s 21 of the Administration Act 1969:\n(a) Mr Pratley is to be discharged from his office as executor of the estate; and\n(b) Mr Steven Courteney is to be appointed to the office of executor.\n3 Courteney, above n 1.\n\n\f[6] The parties also agreed that Steven Courteney should receive the New Zealand-based assets of the estate of the late Joan Courteney, less the following unpaid items:\n(a) the estate's liability for income tax at a sum to be determined; and\n(b) such further sum, if any, payable to Mr Pratley, over and above the $30,000.00 already paid from the New Zealand-based assets of the estate on account of his costs and expenses, as is appropriate to reimburse him for the costs and expenses necessarily and reasonably incurred in his role as executor.\n[7] The parties agreed the following unpaid items are not to be deducted from the New Zealand-based assets of the estate prior to the final distribution to Steven Courteney of the net balance. Those items are:\n(a) the amount of the overpayments to pension funds, formerly in the name of the deceased; and\n(b) any liability incurred by Stuart Courteney in his capacity as the executor of the estate, prior to Mr Pratley's appointment. This includes the Duncan Cotterill costs, which are referred to in my previous judgment.4\n[8] The only issue which remains for this Court are the costs and expenses arising from the defended District Court claim.\nParties' positions\nSteven's position\n[9] For Steven Courteney, Mr Johnson submits that Mr Pratley's costs and expenses in defending the District Court claim should not be visited on Steven. Although he acknowledges that an executor or trustee has a duty to protect the assets\n4 Courteney, above n 1, at [67].\n\n\fof the estate or trust, it is not an absolute obligation to defend every proceeding which threatens the assets of the estate or trust. It is an obligation that involves judgment.\n[10] Mr Johnson relies on Re Beddoe5 and its application in Re O'Donoghue,6 where the Court denied the trustees his costs and expenses, because the trustee was not considered to have acted reasonably. The trustee, Mr Johnson submits, should remain neutral. If Mr Pratley were to be reimbursed for his costs and expenses, the net effect for Steven would be to fund Mr Pratley's unsuccessful defence of this claim, amounting to $73,000, in addition to the $36,000 expense of providing for his father, which he funded. It is submitted this is a profoundly unjust outcome.\nMr Pratley's position\n[11] Mr Fowler QC for Mr Pratley submits that Mr Pratley was appointed by the Court on 12 October 2015, replacing Stuart Courteney as trustee and executor. He was informed that the District Court hearing was to be conducted on 10 November 2015 and on 30 October 2015, Mr Pratley received the files. He sought advice from Thomas Dewar Sziranyi Letts (TDSL), following the view expressed by Duncan Cotterill, the solicitors acting for Stuart Courteney, that he should defend the proceedings in the District Court. Despite his application to seek an adjournment, which was opposed by Steven Courteney, the District Court hearing proceeded and judgment was given against the estate.\n[12] Mr Fowler contends that there was nothing else Mr Pratley could have done, once the adjournment was declined, but defend the proceedings, given that Stuart was not going to appear or prosecute his defence. Mr Pratley took independent legal advice and followed it. Stuart was still the only beneficiary standing to gain, although Steven's application under the Family Protection Act was proceeding to a hearing.\n[13] Mr Pratley was obliged to protect trust property, he submits, and where there is a reasonable prospect of defending proceedings successfully, particularly where proceedings are bought against a trustee in respect of trust property, he should defend\n5 Re Beddoe [1893] 1 Ch 547 (CA). 6 Re O'Donoghue [1998] 1 NZLR 116 (HC) at 121.\n\n\fthem. Mr Fowler submits that there was no time to bring a Beddoe application, with the space of only a week to do so and there is a lesser imperative to seek a Beddoe order, in the case of \"third party\" disputes, compared to other trustee litigation.7\nDiscussion\n[14] MacKenzie and Clifford JJ issued minutes and a judgment respectively,8 expressing concern that Stuart, as the sole executive trustee and sole beneficiary of his mother's estate failed to act.******************************** Hannan v FM Custodians Limited [2017] NZHC 2, [2017] 1 NZLR 1234. *********************\nMr Pratley is to be discharged from his office as executor of the estate; and\n(b) Mr Steven Courteney is to be appointed to the office of executor.\n3 Courteney, above n 1.\n\n\f[6] The parties also agreed that Steven Courteney should receive the New Zealand-based assets of the estate of the late Joan Courteney, less the following unpaid items:\n(a) the estate's liability for income tax at a sum to be determined; and\n(b) such further sum, if any, payable to Mr Pratley, over and above the $30,000.00 already paid from the New Zealand-based assets of the estate on account of his costs and expenses, as is appropriate to reimburse him for the costs and expenses necessarily and reasonably incurred in his role as executor.

At the time this proceeding was commenced the principal sum plus interest came to $3,216,562.31. The plaintiff also seeks additional interest at the agreed contractual rate on this sum from the date of filing the proceedings.\n[2] The alleged debt arises from a loan agreement dated 17 August 2005 between ACTL as borrower and D4 Compression Ltd as lender (D4 Compression). When D4 Compression later went into liquidation the liquidator assigned this debt to the plaintiff.\n[3] ACTL disputes it owes the debt on the grounds: (a) the loan agreement is a sham because the parties never intended that D4 Compression would advance funds to ACTL or that ACTL would repay the loan; instead the loan agreement was only intended to give D4 Compression priority over any dividends that were paid; (b) the loan is unenforceable because funds were never advanced to ACTL under the loan agreement and so there is no consideration to support it; and (c) the parties agreed that the loan would not take effect until ACTL had received royalty payments, which never eventuated.\nBackground\n[4] ACTL owns the intellectual property in computer software known as the \"Matariki Codex\", which has been in an ongoing state of development since the early 2000s. Its potential uses or functions include \"DNA data sequencing\" and \"compression data\". Over the years ACTL has made much of the wonderful capabilities and potential financial returns from the Matariki Codex, which have often been said to be on the point of realisation. However, as at the date of trial nothing like this had eventuated. So far the Matariki Codex has proved a loss-making venture for investors.\n[5] In 2005 ACTL required further funding to progress the development of the Matariki Codex. Existing shareholders were seemingly reluctant to advance further funding. It was then thought that one aspect, the \"data compression capability\", was readily able to be commercialised. Accordingly, ACTL approached Michael Ridgway,\n\n\fwho has a background in software development, to assist with commercialising this capability.\n[6] On 25 May 2005 Mr Ridgway and ACTL entered into a Heads of Agreement under which Mr Ridgway undertook to arrange for an initial investment of $300,000 either by the new investors acquiring shares in ACTL or in a new company, with the possibility of those investors providing a further $300,000 sometime in the future. In return Mr Ridgway was to receive a shareholding in the investment vehicle.\n[7] ACTL and Mr Ridgway decided to incorporate D4 Compression as a special purpose entity to raise and expend investment funds for the purpose of commercialising the data compression capability of the Matariki Codex. Arrangements for this fund raising and use of proceeds were set out in the \"Capital Raising Term Sheet\" dated 27 May 2005, which provided for ACTL to hold 70 per cent of the shares, Michael Ridgway or his nominee to hold 10 per cent of the shares, and the investors (who would provide the funding for the new company) were to hold 20 per cent of the shares. *************************** Smith v Smith [2017] NZCA 5, (2017) 1 NZLR 2 at [99]. *****************In return D4 Compression was to receive an exclusive licence to market the data compression features of the Matariki Codex in a defined territory of the Asia Pacific region.\n[8] Mr Ridgway found 10 investors (the D4 investors). Sometime between June and July 2005 they paid somewhere between $290,000 and $300,000 into the trust account of Martelli McKegg for the benefit of D4 Compression. On 10 August 2005 Martelli McKegg transferred $290,000 to D4 Compression.\n[9] When D4 Compression was incorporated on 28 July 2005, ACTL was a 90 per cent shareholder and Mr Ridgway held the remaining 10 percent of shares. Although they had provided much needed funds in 2005, the D4 investors were not registered as holding 20 per cent off the shares in D4 Compression until 24 October 2006.\n[10] The initial directors of D4 Compression were Mr Ridgway and three persons who were also shareholders and directors of ACTL (Wolfgang Wright, Scott Wilson and Michael Lust).\n\n\f[11] In early 2006 the development of the Matariki Codex, including commercialisation of the data compression capability, was still in progress. D4 Compression had by then paid out approximately $260,000 of the funds it had received from the D4 investors. More funds were required to complete the project. For reasons that I shall address separately, Mr Ridgway suggested that a loan arrangement be substituted for the original funding and use of proceeds arrangements in the Capital Raising Term Sheet. The other directors of D4 Compression and the directors of ACTL agreed. Scott Wilson as a director of ACTL and Michael Lust as a director of D4 Compression executed a loan agreement, which was backdated 17 August 2005 (the Loan Agreement). This agreement provides the basis for the enforcement of the debt.\n[12] The Loan Agreement records the sum lent as $210,000, with an interest rate of 20 per cent. It is common ground that no interest payments were made by ACTL. Initially, D4 Compression issued invoices for interest payments. However, later, either in 2006 or early 2007, Mr Ridgway realised that invoicing for interest created taxable income for D4 Compression, which was a cost it could not afford. From then on, the company did not invoice for interest. Instead, interest was accrued each year by ACTL increasing the principal sum due in its accounts. The loan was recorded as an asset in D4 Compression's financial accounts.\n[13] No further progress was made either in relation to commercialising the data compression capability or other aspects of the Matariki Codex. This meant D4 Compression never received any income from its Licence Agreement. ACTL made no payments under the Loan Agreement. On 19 December 2007, in response to pressure from the D4 investors, two of them (Scott Newman and Timothy Manning) were appointed directors of D4 Compression. However, by late 2009 the D4 investors became completely disenchanted with how things were going. They were frustrated, and they disbelieved assurances from ACTL that progress was being made. They decided to bring an end to matters by pushing for ACTL to repay the loan. However, ACTL as the majority shareholder in D4 Compression refused to do so. There were negotiations between ACTL and D4 Compression over how to resolve the impasse. No solution eventuated. Accordingly, in 2013 the D4 investors applied to this Court\n\n\fto wind up and liquidate D4 Compression. On 30 May 2014 Peters J granted the application and liquidators were appointed.1\n[14] The liquidators were unsuccessful in pursuing payment of the loan. So the D4 investors incorporated the plaintiff on 20 November 2015, and the same day the plaintiff purchased this debt from the liquidators of D4 Compression. In return for payment of $5,000, the liquidators assigned all their rights in the principal sum and interest due under the Loan Agreement along with all interest which may accrue after that date. ACTL was notified in writing of what had eventuated and the plaintiff's solicitors made demand on the debt on 9 December 2015. The demand was not and continues not to be met.\nThe Capital Raising Term Sheet\n[15] The Capital Raising Term Sheet, which was prepared by Martelli McKegg solicitors and dated 27 May 2005, set out the original legal basis on which the D4 investors in D4 Compression became involved with ",

The vendor was King David Investments Ltd (KDIL), of which the second appellant, Ms Ying, was the sole director and shareholder. The purchaser was the respondent, Ms Zhang. The dispute was eventually settled and the terms of settlement recorded in a settlement agreement. The agreement required a consent order, which Duffy J made in a minute of 5 July 2016. The consent order required KDIL to transfer the property to Ms Zhang. Ms Ying and her husband, Mr Young, applied to set aside the consent order. By the time their application was heard KDIL had sold the property to a third party and was in liquidation.\n[2] In the decision presently under appeal, Palmer J refused to set aside the consent order and imposed on Ms Ying a fine of $10,000 for contempt of court in breaching court orders.1 Mr Young and Ms Ying appeal. The grounds of appeal against Palmer J's refusal to set aside the consent order are that the Judge erred in:\n(a) disregarding the evidence that Ms Ying and Mr Young were affected by illness and exhaustion when they signed the settlement agreement;\n(b) rejecting their evidence as to their misunderstanding of the settlement agreement; and\n(c) treating their original defences to the claim for specific performance as having been superseded by the settlement agreement/consent order.\n[3] Ms Ying's grounds of appeal against Palmer J's finding of contempt and imposition of a fine are that:\n1 Zhang v King David Investments Ltd (in liq) [2016] NZHC 3018 [Palmer J's judgment].\n\n\f(a) Ms Ying was not bound by the order until she had been served with the sealed order and, had she been served with the order promptly, KDIL would not have sold the Hoteo Avenue property when it did;\n(b) the order was ambiguous; and\n(c) the penalty was inappropriate.\nBackground\n[4] KDIL owned a residential property in Hoteo Avenue, Papatoetoe. It was subject to a mortgage in favour of Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd (HSBC) as partial security for a loan of $880,000. On 14 April 2013 Ms Ying signed an agreement for sale and purchase under which KDIL agreed to sell the Hoteo Avenue property to Ms Zhang (the agreement). Mr Young also signed the agreement, although he was not a director of KDIL.\n[5] Ms Ying and Mr Young regretted the decision to sell the Hoteo Avenue property and attempted to extract KDIL from the agreement. They maintain that KDIL subsequently offered to settle the sale but Ms Zhang failed to perform. That account seems unlikely because Ms Zhang eventually issued ",

On 22 March 2018 the Court of Appeal is to hear Western Joinery Ltd's appeal against Associate Judge Christiansen's judgment upholding the statutory demand.\n[2] I directed that I would decide the leave application on the papers because there was no time available to hear the leave application during the first quarter of 2018. The Commissioner filed submissions on 20 December 2017. I directed Western Joinery Ltd to file submissions by 21 December, but by agreement the parties sought an extension of time. Having read the Commissioner's submissions, I do not need to hear from Western Joinery Ltd. It is desirable to give this matter a prompt decision.\nProcedural history\n[3] On 28 March 2017, Western Joinery Ltd applied to set aside the Commissioner's statutory demand dated 7 March 2017 served on 15 March 2017. Associate Judge Christiansen dismissed the application on 16 June 2017.1 He extended the time to comply with the statutory demand to 11:45am on 7 July 2017 when the case would be called in the miscellaneous companies list. The parties filed a joint memorandum dated 4 July 2017. The applicant had given instructions to appeal and senior counsel in Wellington had been instructed. The memorandum advised that the parties had agreed that pending the outcome of the appeal the Commissioner would take no further steps in the proceeding and would not enforce the demand. An adjournment was sought pending the lodging of an appeal. Associate Judge Christiansen adjourned the matter to 21 July 2017 at 11:45am. While Judge Christiansen did not say so expressly, time to comply with the statutory demand was extended, given the Commissioner's indication that she would not enforce the demand. If time had not been extended but the time for complying with the demand\n1 Western Joinery Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue [2017] NZHC 1293.\n\n\fhad expired, the Commissioner would now be out of time under s 288(1) of the Companies Act to rely on the presumption of insolvency.2\n[4] When the matter was called before me in the miscellaneous companies list on 21 July 2017, Western Joinery Ltd sought an extension of the time to comply with the statutory demand. The Commissioner objected. I heard submissions. Neither side filed evidence or objected to a lack of evidence by the other side. I extended time for complying with the statutory demand pending the appeal. I said:3\n[7] I am adjourning this matter to 6 October 2017. That is to allow matters to be reviewed. I wish to be satisfied that the appeal is being prosecuted with due diligence and that steps have been taken to obtain a prompt hearing date in the Court of Appeal. I make an order under s 290(3) of the Companies Act extending the time to comply with the statutory demand pending further order of the court.\nThe Commissioner has not sought leave to appeal that decision. She would be out of time if she were now to seek leave.\n[5] At the call on 6 October 2017 the Commissioner objected to time being extended to comply with the statutory demand. She said that Western Joinery Ltd had not progressed its appeal in a meaningful way. She also said that she stood to be prejudiced if she could not start a liquidation application immediately because the specified period for voidable transactions is calculated by reference to the two years before the liquidation application is filed, not from any decision on a statutory demand application.4 Neither side filed any evidence for that call. While there had been some slippage, Western Joinery Ltd had met the deadline for filing the case on appeal in the Court of Appeal. I declined to revisit my decision of 21 July extending time to comply with the statutory demand.\n[6] The Commissioner filed the leave application late. The parties agreed that time for applying for leave was to be extended.5\n2 The presumption runs for only 30 working days from the last day for compliance. 3 Minute of 21 July 2017. 4 Companies Act 1993, s 292(5). 5 Minute of Hinton J dated 13 November 2017.\n\n\f[7] For context, the decisions of 21 July and 6 October were made in weekly liquidation lists. Over the last year and longer the number of cases in a liquidation morning in Auckland has been between twenty and thirty. That is because of the large number of liquidation applications brought by the Commissioner. She is by far the heaviest user of the liquidation court. Cases must be heard and disposed of promptly. Directions are frequently given on oral applications and submissions: adjournments, restraints on advertising, extensions of time for filing defences, substitution of plaintiffs and the like. It is standard to give immediate oral rulings. This relatively informal approach allows for the efficient disposal of the court's business. That generally works for the Commissioner. An insistence on a more formalistic approach is likely to slow the court's process. On both calls I gave oral rulings after hearing counsel's submissions.\nThe proposed appeal\n[8] The Commissioner wishes to appeal only against the decision of 6 October 2017. Her proposed grounds of appeal are:\n[a] I erred in finding that s 290(3) gave the court power to extend the time for complying with the statutory demand pending an appeal to the Court of Appeal.\n[b] Alternatively, if there is jurisdiction:\n[i] I erred in finding that Western Joinery Ltd had prosecuted its appeal with due diligence;\n[ii] I failed to properly assess the balance of convenience; in particular, I should have required Western Joinery Ltd to provide submissions or adduce evidence in support of its application for extension of time; I did not assess the merits of the appeal; and I did not have regard to prejudice to the Commissioner;\n\n\f[iii] I erred in finding that the Commissioner was not disadvantaged by her inability to file a liquidation proceeding relying on the failure to comply with the statutory demand;\n[iv] I erred in finding the prospects of recovery under the voidable transaction provisions of the Companies Act were unlikely; and\n[v] I erred in having regard to a proposed shortening of the twoyear voidable preference period under s 292.\nThe Commissioner says that leave to appeal should be granted because my decision of 6 October 2017 has many errors of law and it undermines the statutory scheme in Part 16 of the Companies Act and the procedures under Part 31 of the High Court Rules.\nPrinciples on applications under s 56(3) of the Senior Courts Act\n[9] It is common ground that my decision of 6 October 2107 was interlocutory and leave to appeal is required under s 56(3). There is guidance on applications for leave to appeal from interlocutory decisions in cases under former s 71A of the District Courts Act 1947, under which leave was required for an appeal to this court from an interlocutory decision of the District Court.

These requirements have been implemented in New Zealand through the Civil Aviation Rules (the Rules), made under the Civil Aviation Act 1990 (the Act). In particular, the Rules impose two relevant requirements:\n(a) First, a RESA must extend to a distance of at least 90 m and, \"if practicable\", to a distance of at least 240 m, from the end of the runway strip (or the greatest distance practicable between 90 and 240 m).2\n(b) Second, a RESA must be \"acceptable\" to the Director of Civil Aviation (the Director).3\n[2] Wellington International Airport Ltd (WIAL) operates Wellington Airport, to which the RESA requirements apply. Currently WIAL operates with 90 m RESAs at each end of the runway, which the Director has accepted. WIAL wishes to extend the runway and approached the Director to ask whether RESAs of 90 m would be acceptable to him in respect of the extended runway. The Director advised that they would be. The New Zealand Air Line Pilots' Assoc Industrial Union of Workers Inc (NZALPA), which has long advocated for RESAs of at least 240 m, both generally and at Wellington, issued judicial review proceedings challenging the Director's decision. The challenge was unsuccessful in the High Court4 but succeeded on appeal.5 Both the Director and WIAL filed separate applications for leave to appeal\n1 Overshoots can occur on landing or take-off and are much more common than undershoots, which occur on landing.\n2 Civil Aviation Rules, pt 139 Appendix A.1(a). 3 Rule 139.51(c). The Director is the Chief Executive of the Civil Aviation Authority: Civil Aviation\nAct 1990, s 72I(1). 4 New Zealand Air Line Pilots' Assoc Industrial Union of Workers Inc v Director of Civil Aviation\n[2016] NZHC 1528 (Clark J) [NZALPA (HC)]. 5 New Zealand Air Line Pilots' Assoc Industrial Union of Workers Inc v Director of Civil Aviation\n[2017] NZCA 27, [2017] 3 NZLR 1 (Harrison, Wild and Brown JJ) [NZALPA (CA)].\n\n\fto this Court. Both were granted leave, the single question being whether the Court of Appeal was correct to allow NZALPA's appeal to that Court.6\n[3] The essential issue identified by the Court of Appeal was whether the Director had erred in law when deciding that a RESA of 90 m was acceptable.7 Important to this issue is the meaning to be given to the qualification \"if practicable\" in the context of the rule relating to RESAs and the role of a cost/benefit analysis in the Director's decision-making.\nFactual background\n[4] The factual background can be stated briefly.8\n[5] The existing runway at Wellington Airport includes at each end a 60 m area called a stopway and a 90 m RESA, which together provide 150 m in additional length against the possibility that an aircraft will over-shoot the main runway area on landing or take-off, or under-shoot it on landing. Both the stopway and RESA areas are also used as starter extensions to increase the distance available to aircraft when taking off, so that the various elements appear as a continuous strip. The following diagram is a simplified illustration of the layout:\n\nRESA\n\nStrip (grass) Stopway\n\nRunway\n\n60m 90m\n\nStopway RESA\n150m 90m\n\n *************************************6 Wellington International Airport Ltd v New Zealand Airline Pilots' Assoc Industrial Union of\nWorkers Inc [2017] NZSC 80, [2017] 3 NZLR 43. 7 NZALPA (CA), above n 5, at [2]. *****************************8 This summary is largely drawn from the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\n\n\f[6] As presently configured, the airport cannot accommodate larger commercial aircraft, unless they operate under weight restrictions. Accordingly, WIAL considered extending the runway. In August 2012 WIAL wrote to the Director seeking clarification on the required length of RESA if it were to extend the runway \"around 200 m\" to the north, across Cobham Drive and into Evans Bay. WIAL expressed the view that 90 m RESAs would be adequate and highlighted various factors, including the likely cost of extending to the north (around $1 million per linear metre) and the substantial economic benefits that extending the runway would bring to the Wellington region. The Director responded by asking WIAL to supply further information, principally the basis for its cost estimate of $1 million per linear metre and likely operational levels, and to undertake a cost/benefit analysis.\n[7] In February 2013, NZALPA representatives met with personnel from the Civil Aviation Authority (the Authority) to highlight the importance of 240 m RESAs generally. NZALPA followed the meeting up with a letter in which it said it was pleased that the Authority had confirmed that a 240 m RESA would be the starting point for runway extensions over 15 m and that an engineered material arresting system (EMAS) would be considered as a practicable alternative to a full 240 m RESA.9 NZALPA also asked about WIAL's proposal to extend the runway at Wellington.\n[8] In July 2013, WIAL provided the Director with two reports, one of which was a cost/benefit analysis prepared by McGregor & Co (McGregor), consultants with expertise in aviation safety issues. That report addressed the benefits and costs associated with having RESAs longer than 90 m at Wellington, specifically, RESAs of 140 m and 240 m. NZALPA later commissioned its own report from Covec Economic Consultants (Covec), dated September 2013, which took the form of a peer review of the cost/benefit analysis undertaken by McGregor. Covec concluded that the McGregor analysis had a number of shortcomings, in particular underestimating the plausible benefits of longer RESAs. WIAL then commissioned an updated report from McGregor, dated October 2013. The updated McGregor report\n9 Various arresting systems are available, which allow airport operators to have shorter RESAs. An engineered material arresting system (EMAS) uses material such as crushable cellular cement blocks to slow an aircraft down � the blocks are crushed under the weight of the aircraft, absorbing its momentum and bringing it to a stop.\n\n\fconcluded that RESAs of 140 m or 240 m were not justified at Wellington on a cost/benefit basis. To gain an independent view, the Authority engaged Castalia Strategic Advisors (Castalia) in November 2013, to review the updated McGregor report. Castalia concluded that McGregor's cost/benefit analysis provided \"a reasonable basis for concluding that RESA options of ",
