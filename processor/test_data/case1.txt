But the Resource Management Act 1991 ('the RMA') testing things. Also testing Local Government Act 2002.

Sections 10 and 12 of the Act says "local governmetn is cool". 

In the RMA, there are lots of cool things.  ss 5 and 56 say cool stuff.

Section 381A says that cool stuff. That section relates to resource management, not LGA..

But that is weird because in section 3 of the LGA ("the Act"), there is not cool stuff. That section relates to local government. s 3 says. Ss 2 to 45B don't read. 

Section 4 says "local governmetn is cool". Lets talk about the RMA.

Section 49 says "local government". RMA section 50 days "resource management". Crimes Act will not match because no date but says "go to jail".

In the Property (Relationships) Act 1976, there is more cool stuff. Section 2 says get lots of money in divorce. and 6

[112] Accordingly, the new statute Crimes Act 1961 requirement in section 3 says that william is a dick.	

--- expected results ---
local government - 10, 12, 3, 3, 2, 45B, 4
resource management - 5, 56, 50, 
property relationships - 2
crimes - 3
