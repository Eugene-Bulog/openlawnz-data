The claims by Mr Wilding then found their way into these proceedings through the (abandoned) first cause of action and the claim for relief under s 174 of the Companies Act 1993 ("the Act"). He had previously tried to use the Employment Relations Act 2000 and the Employment Relations Authority (the ERA) but failed. 

[109] Very late in the hearing Mr Wilding abandoned his first pleaded cause of action, but his claims and the relief he sought are all mirrored in his various claims under s 174 of the Act, which all parties invoke. All breaches alleged have been brought to account under s 174 of the Act, whether the alleged breach of obligation is contractual, statutory or otherwise. For example, Mr Wilding says that WHHL was in breach of its obligations to TML by not offering it a right of first refusal to lease the Lagoon Flat property. 

[110] Some allegations do not reflect in claims to damages or compensation but are relevant to judgment as to how s 174 should be applied, and whether Mr Wilding should have the chance to buy the defendants' shareholdings. All claims and counterclaims reflect in the Interim Judgment delivered.

[118] Section 171 of the Act provides:
171 Personal actions by shareholders against company A shareholder of a company may bring an action against the company for breach of a duty owed by the company to him or her as a shareholder.
[119] For a duty to be enforceable by a shareholder, whether pursuant to the constitution of the company or a shareholders' agreement, that duty must be created by agreement and owed by the company, not by the directors or management, to the shareholder in that capacity.

[120] The duties owed by a director to the company, and duties owed by directors to shareholders, are clearly delineated at law. Directors owe limited duties to shareholders which allow personal actions to be brought in the event of breach. They are restricted to the duties to supervise the share register, to disclose interests, and to disclose share dealings.
[121] The only available claim against the directors for breach of their obligations as directors of TML is under the Act, not under the Shareholders' Agreement, and only TML can make such a claim.2 Directors owe most of their duties to the company, and not to the shareholders: the duty to act in good faith in the best interests of the company (s 131 of the Act); the duty to exercise powers for a proper purpose (s 133); the duty not to trade recklessly (s 135); the duty not to agree to certain obligations (s 136); the general duty of care (s 137); and duties in relation to use of company information (s 145).
[122] Section 169(2) of the Act provides that a shareholder cannot bring an action against a director:
to recover any loss in the form of a reduction in the value of shares in the company or a failure of the shares to increase in value by reason only of a loss suffered, or a gain forgone, by the company.
[123] The law also recognises the distinction between duties owed by a director which are fiduciary in nature, and business decisions within the province of the reasonable director. Self-interest may lead to a finding of breach of the fiduciary obligation of loyalty or fidelity, which constitutes acting in bad faith or contrary to the company's interests.3 Otherwise, s 131(1) has a subjective element to it which reflects the principle that the Courts will not judicially review decisions made by directors.4
[124] Mr Hunt for the third defendant correctly submits that Mr Wilding largely relies on s 131 under the Companies Act 1993, that a director has a duty to act in good faith and in the best interests of the company, and that is the way the case has been put throughout by s 7 of the Resource Management Act 1991.
