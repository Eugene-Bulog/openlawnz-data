UNDER THE

Human Rights Act 1993

IN THE MATTER OF A reference by the Human Rights Review Tribunal


[3] The policy under which the Ministry now pays Mrs Spencer was authorised by the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Amendment Act 2013; and her case, which still lies before the Human Rights Review Tribunal under the Human Rights Act 1993, now concerns only the extent to which, if at all, she is entitled to be paid retrospectively since January 2001 under the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000, before the amendment.
[4] On 4 July 2014 the Tribunal held to the civil standard that between January 2001 Â­ May 2013 the Ministry unjustifiably discriminated against Mrs Spencer, and Paul, under its home based support services policy or practice.1
1 Human Rights Act 1993, s 29Q.
[5] Later, the Resource Management Act 1991 came into force, and section 5 said william blah blah blah.
