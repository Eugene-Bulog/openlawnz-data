[91] The first and third causes of action alleged misleading and deceptive conduct in trade and a breach of s 9 of the Fair Trading Act 1986.

[135] The starting point in relation to issues of privilege regarding mediation or without prejudice communication is s 57 of the Evidence Act 2006. Section 57(1) provides that:

57 Privilege for settlement negotiations or mediation (1) A person who is a party to, or a mediator in, a dispute of a kind for which relief may be given in a civil proceeding has a privilege in respect of any communication between that person and any other person who is a party to the dispute if the communication-- (a) was intended to be confidential; and (b) was made in connection with an attempt to settle or mediate the dispute between the persons.

[136] This section creates two separate privileges, both related to without prejudice communications or preparations for those communications.1

[137] However, the privilege created by s 57(1) is not absolute. Section 57(3)(b) specially provides that s 57 does not apply to:
... evidence necessary to prove the existence of [an agreement settling the dispute] in a proceeding in which the conclusion of such an agreement is in issue ...

[138] Section 57 was also amended on 8 January 2017 by s 21(4) of the Evidence Amendment Act 2016 by the insertion of a new subs (3)(d) which provided that s 57 did not apply to:

the use in a proceeding of a communication or document made or prepared in connection with any settlement negotiations or mediation if the court considers that, in the interest of justice, the need for the communication or document to be disclosed in the proceeding outweighs the need for the privilege, taking into account the particular nature and benefit of the settlement negotiations or mediation.

[142] The issue of the impact of the "entire agreement" clause in the deed of settlement is separate to issues arising under s 57 of the Evidence Act. Counsel for the defendant, Mr Grove, in his closing submissions referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal in PAE (New Zealand) Ltd v Brosnahan8 and acknowledged that, in that case, Harrison J delivering the judgment for the Court, had observed that due to s 4(1) of the Contractual Remedies Act 1979, entire agreement clauses are neither absolute nor conclusive, and the courts have a wide discretion to refuse to uphold them where it is not "fair and reasonable that the provision should be conclusive".9

[143] Mr Grove referred to sections 5D and 6 of the Fair Trading Act 1986. This section authorises certain parties in trade to contract out of the Fair Trading Act and specifically, in sub (2), refers to "entire agreement" clauses.

[173] It is not alleged that the plaintiff was misled or deceived by any of the representations made by the defendant but that third parties were. It therefore needs to be established whether the Fair Trading Act permits an entity other than the person to whom the misleading or deceptive conduct is addressed to seek a remedy for it and, if so, what remedy is authorised by the statute.

[174] There is no doubt that third parties (i.e those other than the people to whom the misleading and deceptive conduct is addressed) can bring proceedings under s 9.19

[180] In the case of Red Eagle Corp Ltd v Ellis, the Supreme Court formulated a test for ascertaining a breach of s 9 which deals consecutively with the requirements of ss 9 and 43 of the Fair Trading Act.25 Sections 43 - 45 are relevant once a breach of s 9 has been proved, enabling the court to provide remedies where someone has suffered loss.

************* This contains a reference to an act, footnoted, and then a reference to a different act. The difficulty is that footnotes appear at the bottom of a page - not at the location of the footnote. Therefore if there is a different act mentioned (here, unit titles) before the end of the page, we need to ignore it. At the end of this part, the final reference to 17 is a non-style-guide complying (ie bad writing) reference to the insolvency act, not unit titles act. Recognising from context that it relates to insolvency may be very difficult. *************

[2] Section 17 of the Insolvency Act 2006 provides that a debtor commits an act of bankruptcy in certain circumstances. A creditor must have obtained a final judgment or order against the debtor for a sum of money, execution must not have been halted by a court and the debtor must have been served with a bankruptcy notice. Further, and of relevance to the present case, it must be shown that the debtor has not, within 10 working days of service of the notice, complied with it or satisfied the Court that he or she has a cross claim against the creditor.1 A cross claim means a counterclaim set-off or cross demand that is equal to or greater than the judgment debt or the amount that the debtor has been ordered to pay, and which the debtor could not use as a defence in the action or proceedings in which the judgment or the order was obtained.2

[3] The judgment arose from proceedings filed by Ms Tao in relation to issues arising in the operation of the Body Corporate of an apartment complex in New Lynn, Auckland. The respondents are, respectively, the Body Corporate secretary, the Body Corporate chairperson, and the Body Corporate itself, constituted under the Unit Titles Act 2010.

[4] In her application Ms Tao raises a number of grounds on which she says the Court should set the bankruptcy notice aside. First, Ms Tao says that as her action in bringing the original proceeding was directed at assisting with overall Body Corporate management issues, she is entitled to an indemnity from the Body Corporate in relation to her costs.
1 Section 17(1)(d)(ii). 2 Section 17(7).

[5] Secondly, Ms Tao says that she has filed claims in the District Court and a complaint against the Body Corporate with the Human Rights Commissioner, which is to be decided by the Human Rights Review Tribunal. These are claims in terms of s 17.

[4] Ms Xiao seeks relief on the basis that the Term Loan Agreement and the addenda to that agreement are consumer credit contracts under the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003 (CCCFA), and that as the requisite disclosure was not provided, the loan agreements are unenforceable. Ms Xiao also seeks to have the loan agreements reopened under the CCCFA on the basis that they are oppressive and were entered into by oppressive means. Finally, Ms Xiao seeks a declaration that the various loan agreements are illegal contracts and unenforceable, being contracts for the provision of credit for gambling by a person conducting gambling, in contravention of s 15 of the Gambling Act 2003.

[5] In addition to Mr Haughey's opinion evidence, there is also the fact that SkyCity is required by s 308(1) and (4) of the Gambling Act to develop a policy for identifying problem gamblers and it must take all reasonable steps to ensure that the policy is used to identify actual or potential problem gamblers. It would commit an offence if it did not, as would its venue manager and its agents.16

[39] After being spoken to further by casino staff, Ms Xiao identified herself as a problem gambler and voluntarily excluded herself for three months from 20 June 2014.3 The exclusion applied only to the gaming areas of SkyCity and not the entire premises.
Self-exclusion period (20 June 2014 to 2 October 2014)

[40] After her exclusion from SkyCity, Ms Xiao discussed her options with Ms Sun, who told her that one option was for Ms Xiao to repay the $70,000 in one go so that they did not get into trouble. Another option was to pay weekly interest until Ms Xiao had repaid all the principal amounts. Ms Sun again told her that if the interest was not paid, then they would both be in trouble as the people associated with the lender friend had `very powerful backgrounds'.

[41] Ms Xiao said she thought about approaching her parents for the $70,000 but she said it would have been quite daunting to tell them. She said the outcome of the discussion with Ms Sun was that she could only get the necessary amount of money by winning at the casino. Ms Xiao therefore agreed with Ms Sun's other proposal that
3 See Gambling Act 2003, s 310.

[459] The loan agreements are indisputably credit contracts within the meaning of s 7(1) of the CCCFA. The CCCFA regulates all credit contracts. Ms Xiao submits that the loan agreements are consumer credit contracts. Section 13 provides:
In any proceedings in which a party claims that a credit contract is a consumer credit contract, it is presumed that the credit contract is a consumer credit contract unless the contrary is established.
[460] As Tipping J explained in Hansen v R:42
[95] ... The composite expression "until the contrary is proved" has a clear, simple and well understood legal meaning. It places a persuasive onus on the
42 Hansen v R [2007] NZSC 7, [2007] 3 NZLR 1.

accused, not just an evidential onus. The accused must establish to the satisfaction of the tribunal of fact the contrary of what is otherwise presumed against him. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities ...
[461] The CCCFA has particular provisions that apply to consumer credit contracts, which are defined in s 11.

[201] Mr O'Callahan's challenge to the admissibility of the SkyCity records was based on the fact that they are hearsay statements and are therefore inadmissible pursuant to s 17 of the Evidence Act 2006. But there are exceptions to the hearsay rule. Alongside the general exception in s 18, s 19 of the Evidence Act provides:
19 Admissibility of hearsay statements contained in business records
(1) A hearsay statement contained in a business record is admissible if--
(a) the person who supplied the information used for the composition of the record is unavailable as a witness; or
(b) the Judge considers no useful purpose would be served by requiring that person to be a witness as that person cannot reasonably be expected (having regard to the time that has elapsed since he or she supplied the information and to all the other circumstances of the case) to recollect the matters dealt with in the information he or she supplied; or
(c) the Judge considers that undue expense or delay would be caused if that person were required to be a witness.
(2) This section is subject to sections 20 and 22.
[202] Section 19, therefore, provides a means of admitting a hearsay statement contained in a business record even if the general prerequisites for admissibility of a hearsay statement in s 18(1) are not met. There is no prerequisite of reliability.
